# The local network interface(s) and port(s) to listen on. 
#
# You may specify multiple interfaces and ports by adding additional entries to 
# the list. Entries can be addressed by any of IPv4 address, IPv6 address or 
# hostname. Note that not all networks have IPv6 enabled, so it is recommended 
# to provide an IPv4 address as well.
#
# Specifying a port of `0` will cause the server to bind to a random port, 
# and an IP of `0.0.0.0` will cause the server to listen on all available
# interfaces.
#
# Available protocols:
# - tcp: Standard TCP socket connections.
# - quick-v1: QUIC over UDP. This protocol is faster and uses less bandwidth,
#       but may not be supported by all nodes' networks. Nodes will always
#       attempt QUIC connections first, and fall back to TCP if it fails.
#       If UDP is blocked on your network then you should not specify a QUIC
#       listener (as it will never be reachable).
#       More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC
#
# Format: ["<protocol>:<ip>[:port]", ...]
# - If port is omitted then the default port 4122 will be used.
# Default: ["tcp://0.0.0.0:4122", "quic-v1://0.0.0.0:4122"]
# Required: false

# The publicly accessible network endpoint to advertise to other nodes.
#
# If this is not specified then the node will attempt to use other peers on the 
# network to determine its public endpoint. This is the recommended
# configuration for most users.
#
# If your network uses an advanced configuration with separate inbound/outbound
# addresses then you must specify this value with your inbound address and
# configure port-forwarding as auto-discovery will report your outbound address.
#
# Format: ["<protocol>:<ip>:<port>", ...] (see `listen_on` for protocol options)
